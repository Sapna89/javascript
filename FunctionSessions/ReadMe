what is hoisting in JS?
if a function is defined using function declaration then that function can be called before its definition.
eg: name();
function name() {
    console.log('sapna');    
}

But we cant do the same if we define the function using function expression
we get reference error. its the major difference between defining a function using funtion declaration and function expression.

HOISTING in JAVASCRIPT is: The process of moving function declarations to the top of the file by javascript engine that execute this code.
