I am just trying to test some git cmds
I created a branch in git

Naveen@NEO MINGW64 ~/Desktop/GitPractice (Master)
$ git checkout -b storynumber-11894
Switched to a new branch 'storynumber-11894'

Naveen@NEO MINGW64 ~/Desktop/GitPractice (storynumber-11894)

Now i have added this txt file. now I will commit it in the new branch without mearging it to the master branch.
